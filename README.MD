## User Story
As an end user, I want to be able to sign up to the web application using only a username and password
1. Username field accepts alpha numeric values only
2. Username is not already registered
3. The password has a minimum length of 8 characters and contains at least 1 number, 1 uppercase and 1 lower case letter
4. Ther user gets feedback when the username doesn't meet the criteria
5. Upon submission of a valid username and password, they are persisted to a database
6. The user gets feedback that he/she has been registered

### No need to address user authentication or authorisation, passwords may be stored as plain text
